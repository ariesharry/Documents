In practicing sustainable organizations, practitioners require to implement Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP) systems in order to aid them in solving a segregation problem over extended value chain. The concept of the S-ERP system can be adopted from an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, however, they have distinction in terms of philosophical perspective. S-ERP system adds new dimensions of complexity, including new data types, new sources of data, and new stakeholders. It is more challenging to be implemented successfully than ERP system. Although various software vendors have developed S-ERP software applications, however, the organizations still have a difficulty to implement it due to lack of master plan that provides a holistic approach to implement the system. This problem motivates the researchers to introduce a concept of the S-ERP master plan in this study. Generally, the design of the master plan is developed based on the concept of project management as it can handle complex and complicated projects. The structure of the master plan contains of three essential components: roadmap, framework, and guidelines. These three components are closely interrelated and each of them has its own role in the S-ERP system implementation. An introduction of the S-ERP master plan concept in this paper perhaps would give a bird's eye view to the practitioners about the imperative of the master plan in order to mitigate problems that occur during the S-ERP implementation projects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Concept; Implementation; Master plan; Methodology; Sustainable enterprise resource planning","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971659918"

Four potential antecedent factors of adoption were derived from the literature, and data were obtained from a sample of 200 executives of the banking organizations of the financial sector across India. A structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to examine the complex relationships between antecedents and the adoption decision. The authors survey the literature to discover and classify critical success factors that are potentially applicable to financial sector. Four broad parameters namely, strategic, organizational, technological, and environmental (SOTE) has been identified for the efficacious development of ERP system in the financial sector of India. 11 dimensions has emerged as significant one for the financial sector. The results show that most of the success factors found in the literature apply to the industry. Nevertheless, distinct differences were found as well. Some factors, such as innovativeness of the implementation strategy, formulation of sound business plan, integration within the departments, adaptation capability of the system etc. would become the key instruments for successful implementation of ERP in the financial sector. The findings can help the executives of the financial sector to focus their attention, priorities, resources and leadership on managing the success factors that have been established to be critical for achieving ERP project implementation and ultimately, leading to the development of the sustainable business model. © 2020 WITPress.

One of the highlighted innovations is the enterprise resource planning and business intelligence system (ERPB), which has captivated the interest of industry analysts and policymakers due to its potential to provide more intellectual information for decision making and ensure its continuity. Firms must use ERPBI appropriately to flourish, as its misuse leads to failure. Even though research has focused on the factors influencing ERPBI adoption, most studies have ignored many factors that influenced the behavioral intention to adopt variable that significantly affects the adoption and use of technology. Ensuring the proper adoption of ERPBI is critical to corporate success. If ERPBI is misused, this will not serve its objective. Although a few studies have studied factors affecting the success of ERPBI adoption, the majority have failed to discover drivers of continuity and sustainability. This article proposed a conceptual framework for ERPBI adoption using the TOE and UTAUT models. Four main hypotheses were formulated for the three dimensions of technology, organization, and environment. The proposed framework is vital in adopting the ERPBI and could shape the direction in successfully adopting new technologies in SMEs. This study could fill in the gap in ERPBI research because previous studies have not focused on ERPBI adoption factors, ERPBI adoption, and business continuity.  © 2022 Jiehui Zheng and Haliyana Khalid.","","Hindawi Limited","1024123X","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132025358"

When talking about enterprise systems, mainly the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), alignment was shown as a critical factor for ERP projects success. The development of cloud computing and the difficulties linked to on-premise solutions implementation are pushing many firms to switch toward cloud-based ERP. However, existing studies on such systems adoption focus basically on benefits and risks issues. Thus, this paper aims to explore the alignment concern when switching toward cloud ERP. Through a literature review, the author first presents the alignment concerns during IT implementation and the factors that could help to achieve alignment. Then, by reviewing the existing studies on cloud ERP in terms of benefits and risks, the alignment concerns linked to such solutions are identified. From this literature review and then a case study conducted within a Tunisian firm, it is showed that cloud ERP alignment is a challenging issue that should involve adaptations (technical dimension) and social practices (social dimension) to be achieved.

Apart from positively impacting health, general hospitals also harm medical waste generated from operating activities as health service providers. Medical waste contains various viruses and bacteria that can endanger the health and pollute the environment if not managed properly. One of the hazardous medical wastes is general hospital solid medical waste. Solid medical waste in Indonesia is recorded to increase every year. Many general hospitals do not yet have a sustainable solid medical waste management system in medical waste management. The management process starts from the preparation stage, such as sorting, storing, processing, and reporting, which are still done separated. Separated process can make it difficult to monitor solid medical waste that follows sustainable standards that do not harm the environment. This study will develop a solid medical waste management module based on the Odoo Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with the QuickStart method. This system can integrate data and information from each division responsible for the waste management process. The system will simplify the preparation process for management, monitoring processing following Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for sustainable waste management, such as whether the waste can be reused, recycled, energy consumed, and indicators for waste processing machines according to sustainable standards and government regulations. In the last stage, waste management can be reported automatically by the system, making it easier to analyze the results of solid medical waste management results and assist in decision-making.  © 2022 IEEE.","Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Key Performance Indicator (KPI); Odoo; Quickstart; Sustainable waste management","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166548165-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141597610"

In order to create a sustainable supply chain, there are five important stages that must be involved: Planning, finding sources, making the product, delivering the product, and managing defects or end-of-life’s. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a set of process, usually in real-time, used for management purposes. Though these two things can stand alone, they work very well together as well. ERP gives SCM the opportunity to automate the sources stage and its inventory, the scheduling of the making stage, the scheduling of delivery, and just reduce blocking between suppliers and the business itself. This study provides the relationship between ERP and SCM and identify the benefits and areas of improvement specifically focusing on the effect on competitive edge. My findings show that although ERP does have a positive effect on SCM, decreases cost, improves communication, and gives a competitive edge, it is still proving to be very difficult to implement. © IEOM Society International.","Enterprise resource planning; ERP; SCM; Supply chain management","IEOM Society","21698767","978-179236123-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105600913"

However, they face the problem of selecting the appropriate ERP, as it entails a large upfront capital expense, leading to question the sustainability of SMEs, especially during the pandemic. A cloud-based ERP system can reduce the risk to a certain level due to their low infrastructure cost and flexible payment options but this has its own constraints. Thus, selection of the appropriate ERP is always a challenge, which motivates the current researchers to explore a decision tree-based technique to predict the most suitable framework that needs to be adopted by a SME in a specific situation. The inferences drawn from the decision tree clearly shows the efficacy of the implemented technique as the right decision can be derived easily by traversing the tree.

Ali (2016) demonstrate that the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation influences financial performance indicators. Huang, Rahim, Foster, and Anwar (2021) had investigated and identified the critical success factors (CSFs) which may affect the successful implementation of C-ERP systems. However, no empirical evidence was found on the relationship between C-ERP critical success factors and financial performance. This study examined the effect of key CSFs of the C-ERP systems on financial performance in the post-implementation stage. An online questionnaire was developed to collect data about CSFs in C-ERP firms. The financial ratios were collected from the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) filings. OLS analysis suggests that financial performance is affected by technological competence, management support, organizational culture, and system characteristics. The study provides empirical evidence on the cause-effect relationship which emphasizes the difference made in long-term financial success by the various managerial techniques. The results provide practical implications to management and service providers that help in installing and maintaining C-ERP systems. © 2022 The Authors.","Cloud Computing; Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning Systems; Cloud ERP; Critical Success Factors; Financial Performance","Virtus Interpress","22209352","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130572697"

ERP implementation projects in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are often driven by research and practice. However, they tend to focus on the 'go live' moment rather than on the subsequent, much longer post-implementation phase. This, we argue, results in decreased utilisation over time and an increased need for workarounds. In this paper, we draw on an empirical study within four organisations which exposes the limitations of KES in ERP implementation projects in SMEs, especially in regard to the preparation of key users. Our findings suggest that, despite key users' essential role in these projects, they are often chosen haphazardly and are ill-prepared. As a result, they cannot fulfil their role of facilitating KES with end users, who end up appropriating ERP systems mostly through 'learning by doing'. This stems directly from complex and largely unrecognised processes involving consultants, hotlines, management, key users and end users. In this paper, we introduce and discuss specific socio-technical, KES-oriented measures which can potentially lead to sustainable KES throughout the ERP life-cycle for longer-term success.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","ERP system implementation; ERP systems; knowledge and expertise sharing","Association for Computing Machinery","25730142","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174505902"

Findings: The results provide significant evidence that the integration of S-ERP systems and LM practices implementation improve sustainability performance. However, there is no significant evidence that S-ERP adoption contributes to the success of LM practices implementation. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, this study is limited to use of a laboratory experiment design. Empirical evidence based on quasi experiments on a field setting would add value to the current literature. Practical implications: Findings provide practical insights for the manufacturing sector managers into the benefits of integrating S-ERP systems and LM practices for sustainability performance improvement (e.g. reducing cost and waste, increasing operational efficiency). For ERP vendors, findings highlight how ERP vendors introduce “enablers” that incorporate LM best practices into their ERP systems and also how those vendors conform to the software sustainability criteria in the design of ERP applications. Originality/value: Contrary to previous studies that addressed the individual impact of S-ERP systems and LM practices on performance, this paper experimentally gives an indication of the impact of concurrent implementation of S-ERP and LM practices on sustainability performance, especially in developing countries. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Egypt; Emerging economies; Institutional theory; Lean manufacturing; Sustainability performance; Sustainable ERP","Emerald Publishing","20421168","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139720818"

It showed a cognitive model on such impact and gave an example in the form of a case study of a global company listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. The basic strategic objectives of each organization include long-term growth and sustainability. In a growing competitive environment, it is essential to manage the company effectively. This can be achieved provided that the company's organizational structure and operations are properly set from the point of view of the ERP system. The research results were aimed at creating the generalized process of the ERP system's gradual implementation, to make the development of an organization progressive. The paper was focused on describing the implementation and unification of the Enterprise Resource Planning System, in a global company listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. The aim of the paper was to monitor and evaluate, the links between Enterprise Resource Planning and Customer Relationship Management. This process is time consuming and costly. To achieve the aim, the case study was carried out in the form of an expert survey aimed at assessing the impact of the unification and implementation of the ERP system in a global company. The study included methods of systemic analysis, methods of sociological expert survey, a method of qualitative peer review, and a method for a cognitive model. It leads not only to effective management of global companies but enables the monitoring and comparison of Key Performance Indicators and the Net Promoter Score in each country, using the same parameters. The implementation of a unified Enterprise Resource Planning system leads to a significant cost reduction and has a positive impact on the financial indicators reported on the stock exchange.

However, some firms do not show positive financial performance after implementing ERP. Why is this the case? An ERP is an information system (IS) that brings about radical changes within organizations, changing both the IS environment and overall corporate business process, which may cause resistance from the organization's members. Thus, change management is crucial, in operating a successful ERP, to addressing organizational changes after the adoption of ERP. The objective of this study was to examine the influence that the depth of business process reengineering (BPR) and change management have on ERP performances. To this end, KOSPI companies with more than a year of experience using ERP were analyzed using the structural equation method. This study confirmed mutual relationships between ERP success factors and its performance. In future research, it would be helpful to determine if companies with higher IT performances actually have better financial results. © 2018 by the authors.","Adaptation to business change; Change management; Depth of BPR; ERP performance; Information orientation; Innovation; Strategy implementation; Sustainable implementation","MDPI","20711050","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052926957"

The authors analyzed the interviews with iterative descriptive and subsequent interpretive coding. Findings – Although considered sustainable, continuously increasing regulations challenge ERP systems.

This topic has been gaining increasing attention within both academia and industry for making the industry competitive. With the ever increasing demand for reducing carbon foot prints and green house gas emission, there is a need to study the various parameters and drivers of sustainable development, especially in supply chain management. The need for developing the sustainable model including the drivers of sustainability needs to be designed. Methodology: Using resource based theory and value chain analysis; we have developed a model for sustainable strategy. The data was collected and analyzed to find the key drivers of sustainability. The data was analyzed with the help of regression and correlation analysis. Findings: After providing a background discussion on GSCM, we categorize and review recent GSCM literature under three broad categories, with a special emphasis on investigation of adoption, diffusion and outcomes of GSCM practices. Within this review framework, we also identified GSCM research questions that are worthy of investigation. The study suggests that the main drivers of GSCM include the environmental policy and the green human resource management by providing them training for adopting sustainability practices. Besides this, another key driver is the sustainability criteria in supplier selection which was found to be enhancing the outcomes of sustainability. Managerial implications and research implications: The model suggests that we need to have management support for implementing the sustainability strategy in the organization. The study guides the managers for implementing sustainable supply chain management practices in the organization. © 2014 IEEE.","environmental policy; green human resource management; green supply chain management; GSCM","IEEE Computer Society","","978-938054412-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903836201"

In particular, it aims to provide a deep understanding of realizing sustainable value from ERP systems and to examine the relevance of benefits management (BM) in this context. To do so, this research applied a qualitative case study approach to investigate the implementation of Tier-1 ERP systems in two firms. Key findings initially suggest five considerations to better understand the realization of benefits from ERP implementation. Consequently, this research outlines the key activities undertaken by the investigated organizations and aligns them with activities suggested by benefits management literature. In conclusion, this research conjectures that while benefits management is a good practice and a systematic approach to realizing benefits from information systems, it may be ineffective in addressing the benefits that emerge in practice, i.e., when integrating the ERP system with modern digital technologies. Therefore, this research advocates either revisiting the current BM techniques or improving the implementation of digital technologies, including ERP systems with BM concepts and principles by incorporating such BM concepts within the implementation process. This study responds to research calls for maximizing the returned value from the implemented ERP systems by providing insightful recommendations. © 2023 by the authors.","benefits management (BM); benefits realization; business value; digital technologies; Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system; sustainable benefits","MDPI","20711050","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152577489"

To explore these issues, we conducted an in-depth systematic review of related research literature. We identified six key issues related to cloud ERP implementation: a) functionality fit, b) integration, c) data migration, d) organizational change, e) data security, and f) reliability. Furthermore, we mapped these issues to the different sizes of organizations. Based on this review, we identify two sociotechnical concerns that influence cloud ERP implementation: linking to the installed base to ensure continuity with the past and sustainability in the future. We argue that these two concerns have different implications for organizations of different sizes and we call for further empirical research. © 2018 The Authors.

This system enables practitioners to effectively practice sustainability in an organisation. Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung (SAP), Oracle, and Microsoft have designed the S-ERP system for various types of industry. However, a number of organisations still have a problem of implementing the S-ERP system as it is a multifaceted system that needs managerial and technical skills to implement. Therefore, they need a master plan that provides a comprehensive guidance for practitioners to implement this system. According to a literature, there is no available master plan that assists the organisations to implement the S-ERP system. This issue will obstruct the implementation process. Therefore, this issue motivates the researchers to develop an S-ERP master plan that encompasses three parts: roadmap, framework, and guidelines. A study focused on the development of an S-ERP roadmap has been performed in the earlier work entitled ""A master plan for the implementation of sustainable enterprise resource planning systems (part II): development of a roadmap"" (Chofreh et al., 2016b). In addition, the S-ERP roadmap has been evaluated in the work entitled ""A master plan for the implementation of sustainable enterprise resource planning systems (part III): evaluation of a roadmap"" (Chofreh et al., 2016c). Subsequently, this study aimed to summarise the development process of the S-ERP framework. This frameworkwould give a comprehensive perspective to implement the S-ERP system. A conceptual research method is used to develop this framework by reviewing two related areas on sustainability and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system implementation and exposing the knowledge gap. The literature revealed that there are diverse dimensions considered in the sustainability and ERP implementation frameworks. These dimensions are generally considered two main paradigms including sustainability paradigm and decisional paradigm. The sustainability paradigm consists of three sustainability dimensions including environment, social, and economic. The decisional paradigm consists of three decision-making levels in an organisation including strategic, tactical, and operational. The S-ERP framework is developed by integrating these two paradigms and unites them into one holistic structure. The breakdown of each component and level of the paradigms is identified according to the relevant literature. Concisely, this framework would be a potential guidance for practitioners to distinguish various perspectives that need to be considered for the S-ERP system implementation. The framework hopefully can assist the practitioners to mitigate the problems during the S-ERP system implementation.

The government enforces the organisations to embed sustainability into their vision, mission, and business strategy. To effectively implement the sustainability initiatives, the organisations need to integrate the data, information, and processes from all sustainable business functions into a consolidated database. This integration process can be executed by a Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP) system, which allows practitioners to centralise all sustainable business activities of an organisation into a single system so that they can monitor their sustainability performance. However, the implementation of this system is a challenging task. Ineffective S-ERP systems implementation can increase the implementation time, cost, and even lead to failure. A master plan consisting of a roadmap, framework, and guidelines is required to lead the practitioners in implementing the S-ERP systems. Previous studies had underscored the important idea of the S-ERP systems as well as the development and evaluation of the S-ERP roadmap. This study aims to develop a framework that offers various aspects that need to be considered in the implementation of S-ERP systems.

These components are identified by incorporating various concepts including sustainability indicators, conventional strategic management, sustainability strategic management, success factors of the ERP systems implementation, and project management.

However, environmental pollution issues associated with MSMEs' leather processing industry, such as turbid water, foaming, and odors in nearby rivers, have posed challenges to sustainable development. The circular economy concept, which aims to extend the life cycle of products and resources, offers a solution to optimize environmental and economic aspects. The circular economy can reduce waste and increase company revenue by adopting circular strategies such as reusing, repairing, and recycling. Furthermore, implementing an integrated sales management system, specifically Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), can effectively support adopting the circular economy and create an efficient sales process in the leather processing industry. It is necessary to identify the appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that apply the circular economy concept and visualize it in the dashboard to monitor all sales business processes and see the performance of sales management.

However, there isn't sufficient evidence which demonstrates how local communities and citizens' benefit from such a costly investment, aside from the improvements in internal organisational processes. The study reported in this paper, used a Case Study design, to collect data from amongst management and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) specialists of a local municipality. The study used hermeneutical principles of qualitative data analysis to interpret the evidence. The findings show that even though it is documented that ERPs are benefits rich, these benefits are not automatically extended to all stakeholders within and beyond the organisation and that there is a need to pay particular attention from a system planning and management perspective to the appropriation of benefits. The study further recommends that managers who oversee the ERPs should augment the self-management capability of these systems to ensure that the benefits are extended to targeted stakeholders, including the citizenry in a consistent and sustainable manner. This can be done through an effective ERPs benefits management process, enabling ERPs self-management and public awareness campaigns.,.","Citizen-benefits; Enterprise resource planning; Information and communication technology; IT benefits; Local government","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited","20488912","978-191081054-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994175774"

Design/methodology/approach: This study adds to institutional management accounting research using a multi-level perspective of institutional dynamics in the smart city context. Data were collected from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SOE that was under socio-political sustainability pressures to implement a smart electricity network project in New Minya city. Findings: Smart city projects have formed social and political sustainability pressures, which introduced the enterprise resource planning (ERP) network as a new management accounting system. A new (complex and multi-level) management accounting system was invented to reinvent the sustainable city as an “accounting city” (which appeared rhetorically as a “smart city”). “Smart” being the visibility and measurability of the sustainability performance of the collective body, which calls the city and its connectivity to different institutional levels brought out in a city network project for the ERP-enabled electricity distribution. Research limitations/implications: This study examines a single case study from a single smart city and identifies the accounting community’s need for multiple and comparative case studies to further analyse the potential impact of smart city reforms and projects on the sustainable implementation of management accounting systems. Practical implications: City policymakers and managers may benefit from the practical findings of this interpretive field-based case study in planning, implementing and monitoring smart city projects and objectives. Social implications: Individual and collective well-being may be enhanced through new management accounting forms of multi-level local governance and increased political, field and organisational sustainability. Originality/value: This study provides important insights into the sustainability dynamics of management accounting in achieving smart city reforms.

This study aims to identify the factors influencing post-implementation ERP capabilities (PERPC) and improving post-implementation sustainability and user satisfaction (PERPSUS). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are used for this, with advance managed outsourced solutions (AMOS) and an entanglement view of all firm ERP users. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model is created to explain internal organizational factors impacting post-implementation ERP sustainability and user satisfaction. Data were collected from 152 executive ERP users in two organizations in the UAE. Two CFA models were created. Findings: The results show that adoption by internal organizational forces leads to more sustainable post-implementation ERP. A 69 per cent variance in user satisfaction and post-implementation ERP sustainability was found through a PERPC model and its dimensions, which are significantly highly correlated. Research limitations/implications: ERP professionals and stakeholders believe that identification of ERP capabilities (ERPCs) and user satisfaction must be multi-dimensional. Practical implications: CIOs and ERP professionals could use these results to increase the success of ERP in the service industry, and they can support the inclusion of post-implementation ERP practices. Originality/value: Using AMOS, this paper explores the role of ERPCs in system sustainability and user satisfaction in the service sector, utilizing stakeholder perspectives and an entanglement view of ERP users in the service industry. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Sustainable development; Technological change; Technology management","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","19348835","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059150822"

Fermi 2749, Ispra, 21027, Italy","Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) is a widely used approach through manufacturing environments in a variety of sectors. With a tendency to go to specialized, smaller lot sizes in several industries (e.g., the pharmaceutical sector), companies are dealing with capacity bottlenecks if the planning rhythm wheel is not well calibrated or when production lines are not flexible enough in terms of changeover (C/O) and set-up times (S/U) (OEE is too small). A well-established communication system including other enterprise resources or production factors (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP) is favorable to any extent. More and more questions arise from stakeholder communities and end-users on whether or not supply chains and manufacturing environments are sustainable and safe. Departments such as Environmental Health, Safety & Sustainability (EHS & S) and Product Stewardship are too often at the “blind” side of the ICT interface. When it comes to product and organizational sustainability, data seems to be lacking in order to conduct sustainability assessments proficiently. Years of intensive research and experience proved that primary data to perform sustainability assessments often are measured through equipment control sensors (e.g., flow rates, temperatures, etc.) and sent to PLCs and many other systems. Nevertheless, these data measurements are in many cases simply not penetrating through the Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) because these bottom-up engineering data seems to be of little value to planning, procurement, etc. This communication paper deals with how sustainability assessments can be embedded in business operational management systems. After all, who does not want a “live Carbon Footprint” for process improvements and external sustainability reporting instead of a series of expensive resource consuming studies of 4 to 6 months digging into data logs in traditional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)? This communication paper has taken one step further in coupling business ERP systems with environmental sustainability of products, services and enterprises. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Carbon footprint; Environmental sustainability; ERP; Lean six sigma; Life cycle assessment; MES; Operational management; Product Stewardship; Resource accounting; Value creation","MDPI AG","20798954","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026895147"

The focus of design for economic sustainability is defining selected key performance indicators and targeting good values for these indicators in AEC. The subject of this research was the idea that implementing ERP systems in construction management could positively affect the financial results; i.e., provide economic sustainability. This research analyzed the ways that these systems can reduce the costs and increase the revenues of construction companies. The aim of the research was to analyze the impact of the implementation of ERP systems on selected key performance indicators (costs and revenues) in AEC. A questionnaire was used as a tool to collect research data. It was distributed to construction companies operating in Slovakia. The research sample consisted of 125 respondents, of which 55 could be used for the research questions.

In this regard, there is a need to integrate information technology and sustainability to enable companies to act in a greener manner. Knowing that the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is one of the most powerful business solutions for companies, it is crucial to align its use with sustainability elements through the use of green information technology (IT). We explored the relationship between ERP systems and green IT practices to assess how green IT provides an opportunity for organizations to improve ERP systems in more environmentally responsible initiatives. For that purpose, we empirically analyzed four Romanian economic sectors based on an online survey that contained criteria to explore organizational awareness about developing green ERP systems. The findings indicate that companies are generally focused on the key benefits of ERP systems related to operational aspects and less on the sustainability benefits. Based on these results, the main conclusion highlights the strong need to embed IT in business sustainability initiatives by adopting green IT solutions. © 2019 by the authors.","Asset lifecycle; ERP system; Green ERP system; Green IT; Sustainability; Virtualization","MDPI","20711050","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070948176"

Grabot et al. (2008) outline the importance of ERP for any company and call it the ‘backbone’ of the information system. Research methods applied: review of the literature; analysis of secondary data and primary data collected by interviews with industry experts. Through qualitative data and interviews with experts, project management (PM) practice was examined to determine the most relevant practice in ERP-related projects. The findings of the empirical part include a list of five methodologies which are used or highly recommended for ERP projects; a classification of ERP projects types, which have different characteristics, work scope and duration; and a list of twenty factors important for PM practice determination. Recommendations from IT and ERP industry experts regarding the qualification of a project’s internal and external factors are provided and an example of a matrix for PM practice determination is described.

Whether the system is limited or open source, had to adapt to certain circumstances. For instance, decades ago, people mainly used to have a paper to work on reporting or to make notes. These days, people started to migrate the work stuff into digitalization. Furthermore, environmental pollution has been triggered by emissions from vehicles. Moreover, due to a lack of knowledge and resources to solve this issue, the manufacturing process does not apply the sustainability process. This matter has led to an impenetrable environmental issue in the manufacturing area for years. Therefore, developing a sales module dashboard system that is configured on Sales Order (SO) transactions and customer data could assist the problem-solving process. The reason for this matter is to highlight the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) at the sustainability that has been added by the open-source Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) System and display the indicator of data visualization application. Furthermore, the development of the ERP system is aligned with the purpose of the Quickstart methodology that was applied in this research. To sum up, the sales module dashboard system is designed to assist the new user in this implementation in classifying the material, process, or products that require consideration to be maintained. Moreover, to reduce the number of raw materials or shipment processes that did not apply the eco-friendliness. © 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

In fact a successful ERP project can cut the fat out of operational costs. But in many firms that have adopted ERP (despite success in the implementation phase of the system), this will not be achieved. The successful implementation of an ERP system is just the first step in achieving a successful system and its sustainable advantages depend on continuous support, maintenance and upgrade of the system in the exploitation or post implementation phase. The post implementation phase is exactly where real challenges begin and many dangerous crises are likely to occur. Numerous risks affect the system due to their size, complexity and high chance of failure. Therefore, risks management in ERP post implementation is a critical issue. In order to help practitioners, this paper studies the risks in ERP post implementation phase and the relationship between the risks of post-ERP implementation activities and the reduction of operational costs in an organization (as one of the most important outputs and achievements of an ERP system) is dynamically modeled with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMS).The main advantage of FCMs is its ability to model complex phenomena based on experts’ perceptions. This tool modelling related and uncertain events by imitation of human reasoning. In this paper, 36 risks were identified and collected and categorized into 5 groups of user, technical, managerial, operational and external risks, and their relationships between them and reduction of operational costs were modelled. According to the findings of this study, managerial risks had the most impact on other system risks and output. © 2018, Curran Associates Inc.

The S-ERP system helps organisations to integrate all sustainability activities into the main database within an organisation. To implement this system, practitioners need a master plan consisting of a roadmap, framework, and guidelines. Previous studies have examined the important concept of the S-ERP system, the development and evaluation of S-ERP roadmap, and the development of the S-ERP framework. This study proposes an evaluation of the S-ERP framework using expert review methods. Twelve experts are involved in the interview to evaluate the content and usefulness of the framework. The results of the analysis show that the initial S-ERP framework should be divided into two parts: sustainability implementation framework and system implementation framework. The sustainability implementation framework includes two aspects: sustainability paradigm (environment, economy, society) and decisional paradigm (strategic level, tactical level, and operational level). The operational level comprising the value chain components of an organisation. The system implementation framework consists of two aspects: strategic and implementation levels.

There is a lack of research in the context of developing countries regarding post-ERP implementation issues and challenges. The high failure rate of the ERP system is a reflection of many management issues that occurred at different phases of ERP implementation. Previous research indicated that even after a successful implementation, the ERP system was unable to sustain itself in the organizations. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory case study design was adopted to proceed with this research process at two organizations in Saudi Arabia. The interviews of the top and middle management are conducted and transcribed. These case studies were further analyzed using the Creswell approach to generate several themes, and descriptions provided a deeper understanding of the post ERP implementation issues and challenges. Findings: Research findings show that for successful ERP implementation, identified factors are top management support, integration, strategy, employee resistance, BPR, change management, vendor selection, team formation and culture. Moreover, factors for the post-ERP implementation that led to sustainability are top management support, training, system adoption, system testing, data migration, cost overrun, employee retention and post-implementation support. Originality/value: This study is unique in its type to examine the issues and challenges organizations face after deploying ERP initiatives. This research's findings were useful and supportive for the senior management interested in successfully sustaining such an initiative in the organization. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ERP issues and challenges; Exploratory case study; Post ERP implementation","Emerald Publishing","0368492X","","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171529048"

They need to align the sustainability strategy with the business value chain. To achieve effective strategic alignment between sustainability and business processes, organisations require Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP) systems to integrate all sustainable business activities. This integrated system helps practitioners collect, process, evaluate, and report data and information. However, the implementation of the S-ERP systems is very complex and needs an integrated approach to its implementation. The practitioners need guidelines that provide details of the process for implementing the S-ERP systems. The literature search revealed just limited guidelines that provide various steps to implement S-ERP systems. This stimulates the present study to develop S-ERP implementation guidelines using conceptual research methods. The conceptual research method involves three major steps including a collection of steps and their activities from previous studies, classification and review of the steps and activities, and the specifications of the guidelines. The analysis results reveal that the guidelines consist of three main components including implementation steps, decision-making levels, and activities. The implementation steps including initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing. The level of decision-making contains strategic, tactical, and operational. The activity involves a number of action plans related to implementation steps and decision-making levels. The results of the study will enrich the growth of research in S-ERP subjects. In addition, developed guidelines should benefit practitioners in guiding them to implement the S-ERP systems in their organisations.

One of the tools that are starting to be widely used in companies, especially in medium and large scale companies, is the use of the Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) system. With the use of ERP, it is expected that each of the company's business activities will be integrated with one another so that an effective and efficient business process continuity can be created. During its implementation, this ERP system also needs to be controlled by the company by creating a measurable Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to ensure that the ERP system is understood by its users properly and implemented correctly so that it can actually fulfill its initial objectives, but in reality there are gaps between the ERP system utilization KPI target set by the parent company and its realization every month. The condition of the gap between the target and the realization of KPI achievement in ERP implementation is a condition that is not desired by any company, therefore an analysis will be carried out to determine the factors causing it and will be carried out using factor analysis and regression analysis methods and then look for a model that can best describe the relationship between these factors and the user's understanding of the ERP Utilization KPIs in the company. The results showed that there are 3 factors that influence the achievement success rate, namely ERP Expertise, ERP Values, and ERP Sustainability.

Related study in SERP systems had been done, however, they only highlighted on the imperative of the system and empirical analysis of the system implementation without looking into detail on how to implement this integrated system. This lack of comprehensive plan and direction to guide practitioners in implementing S-ERP system would result in increased sustainability implementation cost and time and the decline in the quality of products and services. This problem motivates the researchers to propose a master plan of the S-ERP system implementation that consists of a roadmap, a framework, and guidelines. A development of S-ERP roadmap has been underscored in the previous paper. For the next phase, the roadmap is then evaluated by using a peer review method, which is the focus of this paper. The evaluation consists of two main processes including data collection and data analysis. In this regard, twelve experts had participated in the peer review. As a result, the developed roadmap needs to be expanded into two roadmaps, namely roadmap towards sustainable enterprise and roadmap towards sustainable integrated enterprise. From the evaluation results, the experts confirmed that the proposed S-ERP implementation roadmap can generally be used for implementing the S-ERP systems in all types of industry. The roadmap could serve as a theoretical base for further research into S-ERP system research, which can give more insight into the system implementation. In addition, this roadmap could serve as a tool for practitioners in implementing S-ERP systems within organizations.

As additional businesses begin to contend on a worldwide scale, it will become critical for them to streamline their operations and processes. However, it is important to realize that ERP System is not the cure to all the problems a company will face. There are a number of pros and cons of this technology, and those who understand this will be the most likely to succeed. One of the most powerful benefits of ERP System is that it successfully adapted in the many of system architectures of a company. Indeed, this can be why the technology was originally introduced. Another powerful advantage of ERP System is greater levels of information flow, along with a higher quality of information. Given the actual fact that we tend to reside within the modern era, this is critically important. Companies should be able to speedily transfer data from one place to a different. When data is transferred quickly and with efficiency, the company or organization will be able to act on the data within a short period of time. An organization that uses this technology is going to be able to quickly adapt to changes that occur within the market. Though it should need a good deal of company restructuring, the benefits will pay off handsomely in the end. Flexibility is very important today. If a corporation isn't versatile, it'll be troublesome for them to remain competitive.

The post implementation phase is exactly where real challenges begin and many dangerous risks are likely to occur. In this study, the relationship between the risks of activities and the time of activities in post-implementation phase is dynamically modelled using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. The main advantage of fuzzy cognitive map is its ability to model complex phenomena based on expert perceptions. This tool modeling related and uncertain events by imitation of human reasoning. For this purpose, 36 risks were identified and collected and categorized into 5 groups of user, technical, managerial, operational and external risks, and their relationships between them and reduction of time of activities were modelled. According to the findings of this study, managerial risks had the greatest impact on other system risks and output. © 2019 IEEE.","ERP system risks; FCMS; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; Post-implementation Phase; Reduction of activities time","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172811775-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067129873"

ERP implementations have a mix of critical success factors (CSFs) that are very important. Hence, it is essential to study the CSFs, their mutual influence and their severity in terms of prioritization for the I4.0. The goal of the current study is to identify CSFs for ERP implementations, as well as their interdependence and ranking. The CSFs of ERP deployment were discovered by a thorough analysis of the literature and subsequent input from a group of subject matter experts. Using the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method, the shortlisted CSFs were modeled, and after that, the matrice d’ impacts croises multiplication appliqué an classement (MICMAC) analysis was used to classify them. The interpretative ranking technique was used to carry out the subsequent prioritization and ranking (IRP). In the present research, the modeling of CSFs for successful ERP implementations was carried out to accomplish much-needed sustainability in the supply chain. The result revealed the three top-ranked CSFs for successful ERP implementations: “Top management support”, “Change management” and “Business process reengineering.” This research can help practicing managers prepare an ERP implementation plan to accomplish sustainability in SCM. Each CSF’s role can be studied in terms of the mutual relationships for its control. This research can also help in prioritizing strategies for optimizing the resources required for ERP implementations. © 2022 by the author.","critical success factors (CSFs); Delphi technique; ERP implementation; interpretative ranking process (IRP); interpretive structure modeling (ISM); MICMAC; sustainable supply chain","MDPI","20711050","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142724068"

This system enables an integration of sustainable processes, information and data on every level of the organisations' value chain. Leading information technology companies like Oracle, Microsoft, and Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung (SAP) have developed such sustainable enterprise system. However, the problem faced by companies is in the implementation of the S-ERP systems. Due to the absence of a master plan, organisations are not always provided with a thorough plan on the implementation process of the system. This gap in the available knowledge has motivated researchers to engage in the development of a master plan to implement the S-ERP systems that consist of a roadmap, framework, and guidelines. The aim of this research is to concentrate on the development of the roadmap providing the implementation stages of the S-ERP systems. A conceptual research method is used in the study that is mainly dependent on the available literature. Numerous existing roadmaps are reviewed to expose the gaps and inconsistencies. Project management method is used as a basic concept for developing the roadmap. As a result, the roadmap includes three phases (pre-implementation, implementation, and post-implementation) and each of them includes numerous stages to implement the S-ERP systems. This roadmap would be useful for practitioners in providing the stages to implement the S-ERP system in their organisations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Development; Implementation; Master plan; Roadmap; Sustainable enterprise resource planning","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029165742"

Given the results of the grey relational analysis (GRA), respondents consider 33 out of 37 critical success factors to be “very important”. Friedman test results seem to differ from GRA results in 19 out of 37 factors with regard to their ranking. Based on this, and using two different methods, the most important ERP critical success factors are highlighted. For the objective aim of this paper to be fulfilled, there is a contribution giving insights into stakeholders’ perspectives regarding the management of a digital production system in the field of agricultural processing companies. It also contributes to the literature, as it highlights methods that refer to the evaluation of critical success factors for ERP implementation. © 2022 by the authors.

The apparel industry produces fashion items, such as jackets, bags, shoes, wallets, and others. The production process uses chemicals so that the waste can damage the environment. Therefore, to reduce environmental damage, the apparel industry needs to apply sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) concepts. Supply chain activities involve significant warehouse roles because the warehouse is the center of goods flow. Therefore, the warehouse's sustainability aspects must be considered, by designing a sustainable warehouse. The sustainable warehouse implementation needed to be supported by a system to monitor the warehouse's sustainability aspects. This study focuses on designing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) based monitoring dashboard to monitor sustainable warehouses to realize a comprehensive SSCM in the apparel industry. The result of this study is a dashboard system design for a warehouse to realize a comprehensive SSCM in the apparel industry.

It is a massive information system, and its deployment requires a considerable investment of money and time. Unwell plan, limited resources, and weak commitment can lead to the failure of system implementation. Few studies have discussed the concept of Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning systems. However, little research has focused on the implementation aspect of the system, especially on proposing a general plan that can guide practitioners to implement the Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning systems. To address this gap, this study aimed to develop comprehensive guidelines that provide steps and activities for implementing the system. The guidelines are developed using a conceptual research method that relies on the examination of literature to find and integrate various concepts, including sustainability aspects, project management, organisational decision levels, and stratc management. The method envelopes three phases: (i) Collection of steps and activities from the existing sustainability and ERP guidelines, (ii) Classification and evaluation of the identified steps and activities, and (iii) Identification of steps and activities required for the guidelines. The proposed guidelines entail three main modules comprising implementation steps, levels, and activities. The results would be useful for practitioners in giving a formal direction to efficiently implement Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning systems in their corporate value chains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Enterprise resource planning; Guidelines; Industry 4.0; Integrated information system; Sustainability","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073017541"

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which systematically and quantitatively evaluates the environmental impacts associated with the product, is recognized as an essential tool for LCE. However, the complexity of inventory analysis and data structure can discourage the use of LCA by engineers. Most computer-aided engineering and computer integrated manufacturing tools do not effectively support LCA. This paper proposed the conceptual framework of CAX/PLM/ERP-LCA integration for an information environment to address the challenge. The general product life cycle representation is analyzed by tangible product and intangible process perspectives. A multi-view life cycle model is proposed for linking product and process engineering with LCA and life cycle data integration. Following the life cycle model, the integrated CAX/PLM/ERP-LCA system's conceptual architecture is presented, the challenges to the data flows among system components identified and the critical functional requirements of the system to support sustainable product and process engineering proposed. The framework serves as the stepping stone for next-stage work on software engineering. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","IOP Publishing Ltd","17426588","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112772596"

On the one hand, rising procurement costs are a factor - driven by a shortage of raw materials and legal regulations aimed at minimizing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., CO2 pricing), with the current geopolitical situation also increasingly fuelling the pressure to act. On the other hand, the optimization of energy supply also serves the purpose of meeting the requirements of customers and society for sustainable production. One field of action that is still in its infancy in practical use is the exploitation of energy flexibility potential in discrete manufacturing.This is not least because tools for exploiting energy flexibility potentials (e.g., taking advantage of fluctuating prices on short-term electricity markets, providing system services on the balancing energy markets, or increasing the share of self-consumption from on-site generated renewable energy have so far tended to represent stand-alone solutions that have not yet been implemented in conventional ERP or MES systems.)This paper aims to provide an insight into potential business models for the use of energy flexibility in discrete production, to assess the market potential for this and to show why integration into existing systems across all levels of automation is essential.  © 2022 IEEE.","automation; business model; energy; ERP; flexibility; MES; value proposition","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19460740","978-166549996-5","85ROA","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141344701"

Instead of focusing on the usual implementation or short-term post-implementation phases, this study aims to explore what happens to established technical devices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build on a 10-year in-depth longitudinal case study examining a CRM package, a type of Enterprise Resource Planning system specialized in customer relationship management, in a door-drop advertising company. This case is based mainly on 35 interviews and four weeks of non-participant observation, made over three different periods. Findings: Drawing on the literature on drift and maintenance, this study investigates two tensions foregrounding lasting: one regarding the degree of human intervention on the technical device (object being maintained vs object maintaining itself) and one regarding the relationship to the initial expectations towards the technical device (relinquishment of certain hopes vs regeneration of interests). This case combines these tensions and allows to highlight four alterations in the CRM system to show how apparently stable devices keep on changing. Social implications: In a time of resource exhaustion, it is important to reflect upon our relationships to information technology and their modalities of lasting. By stressing that uses emerge from relinquishment and reduction, the authors wish to help organizations move towards more sustainable engagement with their technical devices in the long run. Originality/value: Lasting is not just a matter of being maintained in a context of threat but also builds upon the capacities of a technical device to maintain itself. The self-alteration dynamics that the authors come up with, shedding and ramification, offer a dedramatized interpretation of maintenance that complements studies on institutional maintenance. The results also contribute to studies on technological drift. The authors stress that drifts are triggered by ties that run out, in particular, discontinuation of maintenance in the system. The durability of technical devices in organizations thus does not consist in always more uses or functionalities, but is also made of reductions and relinquishment. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Alteration; Change; Drift; Durability; ERP systems; Maintenance","Emerald Publishing","11766093","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140823109"

Now-a-days OEMs are switching to ‘As-Service’ ERP models and shelving conventional ‘On-Premise’ ERP hosting practices. Since, ERP technology selection is a critical investment decision and crucial for an OEM to stay competitive, technological sustainability through SMAC should be a paramount consideration in the selection process besides relating ERP solutions to OEM’s business and IT strategies and functions. Our work attempts to lay down a comprehensive 4-stage strategic decision making framework ‘E4-arrowhead’ for systematic selection of a suitable ERP system based on a 5-criteria-category (Functionality, Technology, TCO, Vendor and Software Quality) weighted by AHP. A collection of sub-criteria common in OEMs has been derived for peer-to-peer comparison of ERP system solutions. The selection framework considered Social Networking, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud computing (SMAC) for prioritizing sustainability of various solution options. Primarily, the overall company objectives translated to BSCs, are linked to ERP selection criteria culminating in higher model maturity and better applicability in aggressive pursuit of company’s strategic goals.

This research also examines how foreign ownership can affect the performance of the high-technology industry. High technology has been widely used in any industry, especially manufacturing. The research method used in this study was Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The steps taken from this research method start with research planning, implementation, and reporting. This study's evident in how much previous research has discussed ERP implementation in high-tech industries and how to achieve sustainable development goals. The ERP implementation in the high-tech industry will benefit the company as it will make it easier for its departments to carry out its business processes, and the knowledge and expertise of foreign investors will influence the high-tech industry. This research is urgently needed to achieve sustainable development goals, as implementing ERP in high-tech industries can increase operational efficiency and corporate productivity. ERP implementation research can be used to explore how ERP can be used to support sustainable product development. Foreign ownership has an essential impact on the high-tech industry to understand the implications of sustainable development goals.

The aim of this study was to assess if application of enhanced recovery elements through the Francophone Group of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (Grace) in the anaesthesia management was sustainable 2 years after its implementation. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the prospective Grace database between October 2014 and October 2016. The evolution of each recommendation item over time was analysed using non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: A total of 67 and 43 centres corresponding to 2067 and 3022 patients participated to the Grace audit in colorectal and orthopaedics surgery, respectively. Colorectal surgery: Mean length of stay was 5 (± 4) days and readmission rate was 6.6%. Application of most items did not statistically change. It worsened over time for PONV prophylaxis (P = 0.01) and prevention of intraoperative hypothermia (P = 0.02); and improved for NSAID administration (P = 0.01). Orthopaedics surgery: Mean length of stay was 3 (± 2) days and readmission rate was 1.7%. There was a trend towards improvement for most items. It reached statistical significance for PONV prophylaxis (P = 0.001), limited preoperative fasting (P = 0.01). While the use of a perineural catheter (P = 0.001) decreased over time, infiltration of the surgical site statistically increased (P = 0.05). Conclusion: This study shows on a large scale a trend towards less application of all ERP items over time. Continuous audits should be encouraged to expect further improvements. © 2018 Société française d'anesthésie et de réanimation (Sfar)","Colorectal surgery; ERP; Orthopaedics surgery; Sustainability","Elsevier Masson SAS","23525568","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043997241"

Proper management of the system maintenance stage is a basis for efficient system development in terms of business needs. Based on the research and analysis of collected materials, it turns out that making a decision to upgrade the system is equally crucial. We present revealed mechanisms determining the post-implementation approach to upgrade or reimplement the ERP system. The main aim is to determine the methodology and difference understanding to achieve success in the post-implementation stage. The paper shows that the systemic approach to the maintenance stage of the ERP system affects its further decisions: upgrade or reimplement. It has a direct impact on future maintenance costs and the scope of new business demands. This research is an outcome of industry–academia collaboration and based on several developed implementation systems, achieved upgrade and reimplementation projects. Based on case study analysis, we show that reimplementation means an evolution of the current ERP processes rather than another attempt to “reimplement” an unsuccessful system implementation. On the other hand, upgrades are not only a tool or system actualization but the easiest way to bolster company sustainability and to have the information system up to date. The issues discussed in the article will be used to develop changes in the implementation methodology of ERP systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Coping with such circumstances has required firms to align information technology with business strategy in order to exploit their capabilities and change business practices. In this regard, an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system has become increasingly important for organizations to build strong capabilities, improve operational performance, enhance business decision making and compete in a global business context. In other words, an ERP system integrates an organization's resources and also involves business processes and organizational changes. With the ubiquitous growth of IS investment, implementation of ERP systems has grown strongly. Recently, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have started to adopt ERP systems. An example is Egypt, where they have done so to increase their competitiveness in the global market. However, historically, ERP implementation has been shown to have a high failure rate, which is one of the main reasons users resist using the ERP system. Conversely, users' acceptance of the ERP system is the key to the ERP implementation. Thus, this study attempts to find out the important factors that affect end users' intention to use the ERP system during the pre-implementation phase of the ERP lifecycle in the higher education context. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with minor adjustments is the basis of this study. Ultimately, the findings of this research could enrich employees' experience by giving HEIs a tool for better understanding those factors affecting their ability to effectively utilize ERP systems. The proposed model can enhance the current level of the motivating factors influencing employees' motivation to utilize ERP systems.Despite several studies were conducted with the UTAUT model, but researchers paid less attention to the classify the constructs like technological, organizational and individual context. At the same time, limited research was conducted using the variables like compatibility and complexity more especially in educational settings. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Egypt; Enterprise Resource Planning; ERP user's acceptance; Higher Education; Intention to use; Symbolic adoption; UTAUT","ExcelingTech","20513771","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064964532"

In such an environment, where sustainability concerns and awareness of environmental responsibility in industrial production has considerably grown, reverse logistics (RL) becomes more relevant and, thus, its correct management using suitable information systems (IS) is fundamental. Nevertheless, today's IS in general, and in Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) in particular, are developed based on conventional logistic processes that do not contemplate the specific characteristics of RL. The main objective of this work is to analyze the functional requirements of an IS to manage product recovery processes that serve as a guide to develop a suitable ERP for RL. The research methodology has been conducted with a qualitative approach, through which the main specific requirements that an IS must meet to manage RL have been stablished, and a data model for the development of solutions to the requirements identified in an ERP system has been proposed. For the development in the ERP it is recommended to start with the requirement of RBOM (Reverse Bill Of Materials) management, since it is the most complex development and has a greater relationship with the rest. © 2019 by the authors.","ERP; Information systems; Product recovery; Reverse logistics; Value recovery","MDPI","20711050","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070673640"

The performance achieved is obtained through the implementation of an integrated information technology known as ERP. ERP implementation requires a person in charge of a business function called a key user who understands business processes and collaborates with ERP system vendors. The study obtained data that can further process from 77 manufacturing companies in East Java by purchasing an ERP or self-development package. Data processing uses PLS to answer all research hypotheses. The results show that key user capability was able to have a direct effect on the effective design of business processes of 0.643 and integration data management of 0.373. In contrast, it had no direct impact on ERP suitability. Effective Design of Business Processes has an immediate effect on Integration Data Management of 0.338 and ERP suitability of 0.395. The results also show that Integration Data Management has a direct effect on ERP suitability of 0.462. The data processing results for the indirect effect showed that key user capability influenced ERP suitability through the effective design of business processes of 0.507.

Presently, this model has become a core requirement for enterprises that have ERP systems, due to the benefits that can be reaped from it. However, this model suffers from poor usability, due to the usability challenges that are inherited from ERP systems, and the mobile context of use. Adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) were exploited in numerous research works as a means to improve the usability of software applications by addressing their usability challenges through these types of UIs. However, a knowledge gap was identified in finding an appropriate adaptive system architecture that can support the adaptation processes in AUIs for mobile ERP apps. Therefore, this paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting an adaptive system architecture that can enable the automatic adaptation for the UIs' components of mobile ERP apps according to the context of use. © 2017 IEEE.","adaptive system architecture; mobile ERP; usability","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153861984-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046679052"

Oracle NetSuite is the first company engaged in data storage in the cloud. The UTAUT model has four main factors: performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and facility conditions, influencing the system's user acceptance level. The total number of respondents obtained was 84 Oracle Netsuite users, and the data were processed using SEM-PLS. The results of this study indicate that performance expectations significantly affect user intentions, and user intentions significantly affect use behavior. In contrast, effort expectations, social influence, and facilitating conditions do not significantly affect user intentions. This research concludes that the difficulty level using Oracle Netsuite is considered relatively high. However, this system will still be used because management has committed to improving the quality of data processing and analysis, and Oracle Netsuite is deemed sufficient to accommodate this.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The production cost of green products leads to the existence of a green premium, which affects the willingness to pay for green consumption. Moreover, willingness to pay is influenced by the product’s own attributes, such as its hedonic and utilitarian attributes. Our study used the event-related potentials (ERPs) technique to investigate how product attributes and premiums affect information processing and subsequent decision-making by comparing consumers’ acceptance of hedonic and utilitarian green products with different levels of premiums. Behavioral results indicated that consumers were more willing to pay premiums for utilitarian attributes than for hedonic attributes. ERPs results showed that hedonic attributes induced a greater P2 component, suggesting that price increases for hedonic products elicited more cognitive attention in the early cognitive stage and that the high premium condition did not match the hedonic attributes. In the late cognitive stage, where the utilitarian attribute induced higher N4, the consumers used the green consumption concept as a reason to reduce the negative emotions generated by the hedonic attribute and thus were more willing to accept the green premium for the hedonic product. The findings can be used to explain the psychological and neural activities of consumers at different stages when faced with the degree of product attribute-premium and help companies optimize their pricing strategies by using green products’ attributes. © 2023 by the authors.","event-related potentials (ERPs); green consumption; green marketing; green premium; N4; P2","MDPI","20711050","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148016786"

It also enables companies to be more responsive to market demands and changes in resource availability. The use of digital technologies and smart systems in mining and power production is therefore crucial for the development of Industry 4.0 and the transition towards a more sustainable and interconnected economy. Based on these approaches, the paper presents a developed and applied private cloud ERP model, which has three modules: virtual part – based on cloud computing model (SaaS model) or private cloud, business part – uses IoT to connect business processes (procurement, sales, management, finance, warehouse, downtime tracking), production part – tracking production (at the open-pit coal mine) and technological processes (tracking and maintenance of auxiliary equipment).

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) technologies have great potential to facilitate firms in achieving sustainable competitive advantages and to survive in such situations. However, the adoption of ERP among Jordanian SMEs has been reported as relatively low, which, in turn, does not affect SMEs effectively. Therefore, this study aims to examine the roles of the external forces (mimetic pressure (MP), coercive pressure (CP), and normative pressure (NP)), and Environmental Uncertainty (EU) on the adoption of ERP. Through the use of institutional theory and contingency theory, this study includes the role of EU as a moderating variable in the relationships between institutional factors (MP, CP, and NP) and ERP adoption. Data were collected from small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in Jordan. A total of 741 questionnaires were distributed to the selected SMEs, of which 192 were returned and used for analysis. The empirical data were analyzed using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results show that MP, CP, NP, and EU have significant direct relationships with ERP adoption; however, contrary to our expectations, EU did not moderate the relationships between institutional factors and ERP adoption. These findings provide important insights for managers, researchers, and policy makers, helping them to understand the importance of ERP system adoption in enhancing firm performance. One limitation of this study is that it is based only on SMEs. Therefore, future studies can concentrate on the development of such research not only in SMEs, but also using larger organizations. © 2020 by the authors.","Contingency theory; Environmental uncertainty; ERP; Institutional theory; Jordan; SMEs","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","21998531","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092612135"

The products needed to handle the spread of the virus are in high order, and there is even a product shortage. Products that are not required to prevent a pandemic have stagnated so that the manufacturing industry suddenly reduces capacity. Manufacturing companies need to coordinate quickly to be able to adjust the disruption. Manufacturing companies already have an integrated information technology system that has been the primary process in Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP). Manufacturing companies make ERP their primary system, so they need to be updated and adjusted as needed. This study obtains a questionnaire from Indonesia's manufacturing industry using the google form link and distributed through social media WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. Data processing was carried out by using the partial least square of 285 manufacturing company respondents. The results showed that ERP sustainability was able to influence supply chain integration (internal and external). External integration has an impact on information quality, while internal integration does not affect. Supply chain integration and information quality affect increasing firm performance.

It also offers more characteristics such as information technology agility and scalability, business processes enhancement and competitiveness enhancement. This makes the cloud ERP system essential to the sustainability of SMEs. However, the adoption rate of the ERP cloud between SMEs has been reported as a little low compared to other information systems such as ERP. To address this gap, we developed a conceptual framework for understanding the intentions of SMEs towards the adoption of the cloud ERP and investigating the comprehensive factors that impact or impede the adoption of the cloud ERP. A framework focused on the theories of technology, organization, environment framework (TOE), diffusion of innovation theory (DOI), Iacouvo model, critical mass theory (CMT). Therefore, this structure is intended to help SMEs managers understand and improve their predictive potential for cloud ERP adoption.

Many Western international locations have already contributed in managing the public transportation machine and their routes for the humans of their US. and that is the principal reason why they are counted as a developed USA due to the fact managing public transportation and management of the routes additionally effects the financial boom of country. In Pakistan, particularly in the city Karachi, there is no such kind of improvised administration for public transport or for the routes they are following. This report carries the records about the android application and discussed its working in element that how it contributes to manipulate the bus routes (as buses in Karachi viewed as predominant public transport facility and preferable than other transport facility). The goal of this challenge is very clear i.e. to make it easier for the people to reap expertise about the bus routes and their timing of arrival and departure. This application manages all the information about the buses and their routes. Also, one can effortlessly tune himself/herself to make positive that he/she is going in the right direction. Different algorithms to locate shortest route for the passengers has also been applied. The scope of this utility is very large as it is concentrated on all passengers of Karachi who are inclined to use buses as public transport. The common influence of this software on the country's financial system will be amazing as greater human beings will select to use public transportation.

Background Although earlier studies have discussed the critical success factors of the failure or success of an ERP system and the extent to which it achieves its desired objectives, the current study focused on the significant impact of socio-technical elements and decision-making environment on the success of the ERP system (i.e., sustainable performance). In addition, the lack of research on ERP as a mediator in the above relationship motivated this study to bridge the literature gap. Methodology The data was collected using questionnaires distributed to 233 randomly selected employees of three multinational companies (BP, LUKOIL, and Eni) operating in Iraq. The structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypothesized relationships.; Contribution The study contributes to the literature by examining the mediating role of the ERP system in the relationship between socio-technical elements and the decision-making environment, as well as, the moderating role of organizational culture in the relationship between socio-technical elements and ERP systems.; Findings The results showed that ERP is a significant mediator between the linkage of socio-technical elements and the decision-making environment while organizational culture has an insignificant moderating role in the relationship between socio-technical elements and ERP systems. Recommendations for Practitioners In a developing country like Iraq, there is a need to implement ERP to achieve better sustainable performance through change management and organizational development that ultimately work towards enhancing individual capabilities, knowledge, and training. Recommendations for Researchers The researchers are recommended to conduct an in-depth study of the phenomenon based on theoretical and empirical grounds, particularly in light of the relationship of socio-technical elements and decision-making environments. Impact on Society This study provides a reference for organizations with similar cultural backgrounds in using ERP systems to minimize pollution in Iraqi context. Future Research A more in-depth study can be performed using a bigger sample, which not only includes the oil industry but also the other industries. © 2018 Informing Science Institute.

The ERP implementation phase is a very costly and time-consuming process. The failure of the implementation may result in the entire business to fail or to become incompetent. This fact along with the complexity of data streams has led the researchers to develop a hierarchical multi-level predictive solution to automatically predict the implementation success of ERP solution. This study exploits the strength and precision of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for predicting the implementation success of ERP solutions before the initiation of the implementation phase. This capability is obtained by training the ANFIS system with a data set containing a large number of ERP implementation efforts that have led to success, failure, or a mid-range implementation. In the initial section of the paper, a brief review of the recent ERP solutions as well as ANFIS architecture and validation procedure is provided. After that, the major factors of ERP implementation success are deeply studied and extracted from the previous literature. The major influential implementation factors in the businesses are titled as Change Orchestration (CO), Implementation Guide (IG), and Requirements Coverage (RC). The factors represent the major elements that guide the implementation project to a final success or to a possible failure if mismanaged. Accordingly, three initial ANFIS models are designed, trained, and validated for the factors. The models are developed by gathering data from 414 SMEs located in the Islamic Republic of Iran during a three-year period. Each model is capable of identifying the weaknesses and predicting the successful implementation of major factors. After this step, a final ANFIS model is developed that integrates the outputs of three initial ANFIS models into a final fuzzy inference system, which predicts the overall success of the ERP implementation project before the initiation phase. This model provides the opportunity of embedding the previous precious experiences into a unified system that can reduce the heavy burden of implementation failure. © 2020 Iranian journal of Management Studies.","ANFIS; ERP; Prediction; Success; Sustainable Implementation","University of Tehran, College of Farabi","20087055","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105882186"

Rather than becoming function-oriented, firms are now selectively deploying valuable resources on automated processes operated through technology-enabled ‘information communication’ platforms to improve performance. However, there are visible gaps in integrating business processes with information-enabled domain like enterprise resource planning (ERP), which has the potential to bring in the radical improvement in firm’s performance. Again, integration always does not come with positive results, specifically to Indian capital goods sector.

These systems can organize, and maintain data remotely, accept a pay-as-you- use method and enhance related information through a cloud computing platform. Hence, this makes the cloud ERP system crucial for their sustainability and enables them to become competitive in the market. However, the adoption rate of cloud ERP among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) has been recorded as slightly low compared to other enterprise systems like Customer Relationship Management. This could be attributed to unclear adoption factors among SMEs and the lack of a theoretical model that can enhance the predictive power to adopt a cloud ERP system. To address this gap, the objective of this study is to develop a conceptual model by which to investigate the broad factors which influence or inhibit the adoption of cloud ERP, the model based on TOE, DOI and FVM. Thus, this model intends to help SMEs managers understand and increase predictive capacity on cloud ERP adoption. The model has been constructed using four dimensions, namely; task, technology, organization and environmental. Findings from this study are projected to be able to instruct SMEs decision-makers on the factors that will lead to successful adoption.

By employing a holistic approach focusing on the current characteristics of both ERPSs and automation platforms and an inductive approach to perform a content analysis, this study highlights how the new generation of ERPSs can support the improvement of accounting in general and sustainability accounting and reporting quality in particular. The analysis was based on information provided by the developers of leading ERPSs and automation platforms with a significant worldwide market share. In this paper, we deepen the understanding of the role that ERPSs play in improving sustainability accounting and reporting, focusing on both the benefits and challenges derived from the impact generated by increasing the integration of robotic process automation and intelligent process automation solutions. The results obtained have academic and managerial implications, addressing a research gap concerning the understanding of the consequences of ERPSs evolution from the perspective of professionals and the competitive edge companies can take advantage of to improve sustainability reporting and accounting processes. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; ERP systems; intelligent process automation; robotic process automation; sustainability accounting; sustainability reporting","MDPI","20799292","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156251570"

The technological development nowadays have encouraged them to adapt in order to maintain their sustainability. ERP System has present as one of the information system software package that has been widely implemented by various business organizations. This study aims to test how accountant in SMEs will be satisfied in using ERP System by the accounting benefits provided in four aspects, IT, Operational, Organizational, and Managerial, and the acceptance of using new system by TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) which consists of Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU) aspects. The Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) was used as the data analysis technique. The sample consists of 66 respondents (accountants) who operate the ERP System directly at their workplaces. The results show that IT and Managerial Accounting Benefits and TAM (PEOU and PU) do not significantly affect accountant satisfaction. Meanwhile, Operational and Organizational Accounting Benefits positively affect accountant satisfaction.  © 2023 IEEE.","accountant satisfaction; accounting benefits; ERP System; perceived ease of use; perceived usefulness","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835030331-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182946478"

ERP provides a concept that integrates a whole series of business processes, so they are mutually sustainable as part of business management to achieve the goals of an organization. In line with the hospital's information system, ERP provides a solution for managing data information that runs in hospitals. As one of District Government Hospitals in Indonesia that provide health services, RSUD XYZ does not have an independent information system that manages the hospital's vital data specifically in warehouse management yet. Procurement and management of goods on a regular basis without a system managing in terms of inventory bring through redundancy, ineffective, and inefficient management of data in the warehouse. This research focuses on the planning model system for the public hospital in inventory management business processes, developed using OpenERP at Inventory Management module and QuickStart method. The results of this study is a design of a planning model for inventory management system in the public hospital. This research explains how the ERP system can help improve health services in the public hospital under business processes that should be in the healthcare industry.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","IOP Publishing Ltd","17578981","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098322929"
